The test cases in this directory can be used as regression tests to ensure 
newly added functionality does not break things that worked previously. The 
regression tests can be ran using the ./regress found in the directory. Below 
is a listing of what each test was designed to ensure following tests could 
use properly. Please keep in mind that both the tests and this file are works 
in progress.

TESTS
Include files
Separate compilation
Makefile?

1) outs
2) if (const) else
3) Expressions with all operators
    NOTE: Also includes nested ifs
4) for loop
    NOTE: Also includes io.h
5) while loop
6) Character arrays and pointers
    Assigment ptr = array
    pointer arithmetic
7) string library
    string functions including printi
8) Function calls
    return values
    functions in expressions
9) Pointer arithmetic
10) void functions
11) function call via function address
12) variable init on decl line

21) Make sure const ints are correct type (char/int)
22) Hex values and bitwise operators (more earlier?) ###################
23) Addresses and derefferences of multple stars
    check for completeness and validity     ###################
24) More addresses and derefference (combine with 23) ###################
25) Global multi-star pointers
26) more structs? No sure of diff from 13
27) More pointer stuff

38) Type casts
39) Test that pre-inc doesn't mess up the stack
40) Test trap handlers
49) Test gen_io device
50) Test handling of arrays of pointers
51) Test that arrays of pointers can be passed to functions
52) Test conversion of hex numbers
53) Test user mode machine checks
54) Test INP, EXEC, and PRINTS functionality
55) Test return types and existence matches function declaration
56) Test that empty compilation units don't cause seg faults
